# Airline-Safety

This is a small project using some data on the airline industry from the past several decades. It's fairly straightforward and I did it mostly out of personal curiosity. It is
fairly revealing and somewhat surprising!

Data retrieved from FiveThirtyEight right here on GitHub (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data).

Have a look at the dashboard for it here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/todd3092/viz/AirlineSafety_16741242426240/Dashboard2.
